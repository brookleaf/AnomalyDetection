Part 2 In a few paragraphs please describe what you would do next, given that after a while a large number of boilers will be monitored and individual patterns of behaviour identified, in order that we can apply a model to a new boiler without seeing any data from it or knowing anything about its usual operating behaviour. 


First the protocol to onboard a new unseen boiler will depend on features/characteristics that define boiler itself e.g. max pressure, manufacturing features.
Every boiler goes through an onboarding procedure that captures data about the boiler itself.

On these above said features we would then build a model that clusters the boiler into its best group of already modelled boilers.
Now that we identified the best group/cluster for our new boiler, we would then pick the model of the boiler which was essentially
the centroid in our group thus identified. The understanding is that the centroid boiler will effectively have been modelled based of
an average of the time series of all the boilers in that group.

The model of the centroid boiler is then put into effect for prediction of outliers for the new boiler until we have enough data thats relevant from the boiler itself.

Having collected suffienct data from the new boiler, we can either build a model thats specific to it or we could revisit clustering the timeseries data from the boiler against the remaining timeseries data of the other boilers to update the centroids.
